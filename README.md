Species reports


The written assessment for this module   is   a report   on   a   single   species.It   should   take   the general   approach   of   the   included   sample   on   a   species   of   bat.Obviously   this   will   need   to   be tailored to your organism of   choice depending on   what   scientific   data   is   available   on   it.The   report   should   in   essence be   a brief   review   of a   selected   species-its basic biology   and   areas   such as its evolutionary history   and   scientific   importance.
Each report   should be produced professionally   i.e.make   sure   everything   is   formattedsensibly,use   references   appropriately   and   cite   them   correctly,write   in   formal   scientific   language,italicise   and   capitalise   scientific names   correctly   etc.These   are   supposed to be   short reports   so write   appropriately,keep   thing   short   and punchy.
·It   should   be:-between    1000-1250    words   long(i.e.the   absolute   maximum   is   1250).Include   all text   figure legends,etc.in   the   count,but   exclude   the   references   -include   2-4 figures.
-There   should   be   5-10   references(10   is   a   maximum).
-Use   appropriate   scientific   sources,figures   aside,you   should   be   citing   as   far   as   possible from the primary   scientific literature.We   are   aware though that   for basic   information   like size or gestation this can be hard to   find   and   you   may   have   to   resort   to   text books   etc.but   put   real   effort   into this research   and   avoid using   sources   like   Wikipedia,encyclopedias,field guides,random   websites   etc.
-We   prefer   Harvard   referencing   style   e.g.:
Hutchinson,J.R.and    Garcia,M.,2002.Tyrannosaurus    was not a fast   runner.Nature,415,pp.1018-1021.
(Note it does not have to be   Harvard   referencing   style,but   it   does   need   to be   consistent,and   it   must   not   use   numbers   in   the   text   to   cite   the   article).
-We   do not need the DOI   or URL   for   references   or   the   date   accessed.You   only   need   information like this   for   sources that can be   edited   (e.g.for   images   online   or media   pages).
-Any   figures   from   the   web   or published   formally   (i.e.copy pasted)should be referenced   under a heading called   "References to images".These   do   not   count   towards   your    10   references or word count.
Include   in   each report:
-The   formal   scientific name   and   common name   (if any).   -Date   and   original   describer   of   the   species.-Any   taxonomic   history   (synonyms,changed   names   etc.-this   should   usually   be   brief,some   things   have   a   nightmare   back   catalogue   of   names   in   which   case   be   judicious   and   simply   note this).
-The   systematic position   i.e.a   list   of major   clades   to   which   it belongs   (e.g.for   a pigeon   this   would    代 写BIO212 Species reportsSQL

-Definition/diagnosis/key   features   of the    species.Thisshould   correctly   define   a   species,   ideally taken   from a relevant paper on the   subject.This   may   be   hard   to   find   for   some   taxa. Keep it   short.
-Review of   basic biology/anatomy and physiology /behaviour/reproductive biology/ecology/scientific importance      etc.(the vast majority of   your write up).These   will   vary greatly   between   reports   depending   on   your   interest/research/what   information   is   available.




You don't have to cover everything and   3   or 4   good   sections   is   better   than   8   short   ones   with   no   depth.You may work in groups of   up to   3   people.Pairs   are   strongly   recommended   though   you   are welcome to work alone.All members   of   the   group   will   get   the   same   grade.Clearly   mark   all people   in your   group,in the   following   way,Group    member       1:name,email,advisorGroup      member      2,name,email,advisorGroup    member       3,name,email,advisor
Remember this is worth   a   significant part   of   a 30   credit   module.So   while   the   word   limit and reference limit is tight,we are   expecting you to   put   a   lot   of hours into   this   and   we are expecting very high standards.There should be a real depth of   research and real   quality   of writing-we   expect   something   well-researched   and   polished.So   put   a   lot   of time      into   finding   and reading   sources,planning what   areas   you want to   cover,writing   and   editing   to make it the best you can.
This   is   due to be   submitted   in Week   10.Check the   QM+page   for the   exact   date   and   time.         Submit one document with the names and   student   numbers   of   all   participants.Please   ensure   the   name   of   the   taxon   is   at   the   start   of   the   file   name   and   the   family   name   of   the   person   who    submitted   it.
